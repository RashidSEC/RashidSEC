# $ whoami?

My name is Rashid, my two main interests are information security and business.

I'm currently studying at the University of Florida in Gainesville Florida.

I will graduate with a Bachelors of Science in Business Administration in Spring of 2023.

I'm also a candidate for the Information Systems and Operations Management Combined Masters <br> so I can better combine business and IT. </br>
